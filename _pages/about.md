Hi, I am Wei Zhu, a 3-rd year Ph. D. student from the [department of computer science](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/), [University or Rochester](https://rochester.edu/) Rochester, NY. My advisor is [Prof. Jiebo Luo](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/). Prior to coming to UR, I received my M.S. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an China in 2018 advised by [Prof. Feiping Nie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2oB4nAIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ&hl=en). I am interested in representation learning, federated learning, few-shot learning, fairness/debiasing and their applications in healthcare data, natural images, multivaraite time series data, and medical images.
